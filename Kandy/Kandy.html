  <img class="glake3" src="garden/3.png" width="375" height="255">

  <p class="para5">When King Wickramabahu III assumed the throne and established court in Peradeniya, close to the Mahaweli
    river, the Botanic Gardens first appeared. This was in 1371. Rajadhi Rajasinghe and King Kirti Sri came
    after that. King Wimala Dharma had a temple built here, but the British, who had taken over rule of
    the Kandyan Kingdom, demolished it.Then, in 1821, Alexandar Moon laid the foundation for a botanical garden.
    He cultivated coffee and cinnamon plants in the garden.[4] Plants from Kew Garden, Slave Island, Colombo, and
    the Kalutara Garden in Kalutara were used to create the Peradeniya Botanical Garden, which was officially 
    founded in 1843. Greater independence was granted to the Royal Botanic Garden, Peradeniya.<br></p>
     


  <h2 class="kandy3">3. Kandy Lake</h2>
  <p class="para5">Built in 1807 by King Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe near to the Temple of the Tooth, Kandy Lake , also
    known as Kiri Muhuda or the Sea of Milk, is an artificial lake in the center of the hill city of Kandy, Sri Lanka.
    Its size was diminished over time. Fishing is prohibited since the lake is protected. Kandy Lake covers an area of 6,544 square meters. The radius is 3.21 kilometers. 18.5 meters is the maximum depth.
    The parapet wall, known as Walakulu Bemma, is 633.82 meters long and has the appearance of a cloud. In the past, 
    the structure at the lake's center, together with several antiquated ruins, was referred to as Diyatilaka Mandapaya.
    This pavilion is thought to have been utilized by the Kings for leisure.There are places to walk or run around Kandy 
    Lake. Views of the hills and the town are available from the trail that circles the lake in the shade. Atop a hill 
    overlooking the lake sits the Malwatte temple, one of the two main temples of the Theravada Buddhist Siyam Nikaya sect.<br>
    <br><br>
    Tigolwela, a section of paddy fields, was once the lake in front of the Temple of the Tooth. King Sri Wickrama
    Rajasinha transformed it into a lake in 1807. The lake built afterwards was also called Kiri-muhuda since there
    had previously been a pond with the name Kiri-muhuda in the center of the Tigolwela. Kandy Lake
    is credited to architect Deveda Moolacharya. The steps leading into the lake by the Mahamaluwa are still
    discernible on the Paththirippuwa (octagon) side, where the monarch initially constructed a dam across the paddy
    fields, extending over to the Poya-maluwa. The dam, on which a road was built, made it possible for the king to
    cross over to the Malwatte Vihare.<br>

   <p class="para8">Some of the timber used for the "Drummers' Hall" is reported to have come from a Gampola "Royal Audience Hall" that

    of the best specimens of Sinhalese art can be found on the carvings that grace the wooden pillars of the drummers'
    hall and the "Vahalkada" (the Devala's entrance porch, which is thought to be older). The wooden pillars have an 
    octagonal base and a square-shaped "Pekada" at the top made of four leaves. The carvings of interwoven swans, double
